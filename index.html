      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Walter studied at the California Institute of Technology, but I study at Kellogg. He proved himself a brilliant chemist with a specialty in X-ray crystallography. I'm adept at other things. In 1985, Walt's groundbreaking research regarding photon radiography contributed to a project that was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1985 my dad was mad at the fact that he was about to have a thrid kid, I am the 5th! Following his education, Walter went on to co-found Gray Matter Technologies with his friend, Elliott Schwartz. My education is ongoing, and I want to take over A1A Car Wash.
